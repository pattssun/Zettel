- chatGPT released
- google execs freak out
- google consolidates (integrates Deepmind, Brain)
- google assembles a giant team to build a single giant language model (spoiler: it's gemini)
- team defines success as building the system that gets the best performance on MMLU
- team starts building model
- finds out that beating GPT-4 level performance is really hard
- many cycles of experimental iteration ensue, all with bottom-line MMLU performance dictating success
- data mix, architectural decisions, training hyperparameters, etc. are chosen **to maximize MMLU score**
- Google releases Gemini Ultra, a model that gets the best MMLU score in the world, but isn't nearly as generally capable as GPT-4

Oh, and you *will* need to raise since your venture‚Äôs unit economics don‚Äôt make sense. Remember, you pay $0.30 every time someone asks a doofus question to ChatGPT. Heck, I sometimes ask the same thing 5 times. 

Also, the last deal at $80 billion valuation - is as dead as the Egyptian pharaohs. Glorious to write about and visualize. But super dead, under the sand, not coming back. 

Not only that - but you sideswiped your biggest partner, Microsoft. Of course publicly they will say the right thing, but you know and they know it and a random fellow like me knows it - they must be seething mad about it. 

Few of your top researchers have already quit, and if there is one thing Sam Altman is especially good at, it is raising and deploying capital. Before the sign with your name and title as ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefacto CEO‚Äù gets emblazoned in the OpenAI offices, Sam would have a new company, $1 billion investment and offers out to all your, soon to be ex, top product people and researchers. 

So you head into next week having lost your top dealmaker, top researchers, top product visionary, top partner and top investor, and with a business which has terrible unit economics.  

And let‚Äôs not forget - the two of you are not entrepreneurs. Most people in your board have never held a proper tech job ever. You have never had to face the abject rejection which follows from pitching many investors, going through the process, and getting to close. Getting to close is the toughest. Sometimes investors say yes, but they don‚Äôt actually mean it. Sometimes they even sign, and still don‚Äôt wire the funds. You will need to live through all of it, the pain and rejection, and feel intense amount of pressure of having to provide for your team members - who pays their mortgages, car loans, kids school tuition - the ones whom you played with at the last company picnic. 

After you are exhausted with the realities of the market - you will sell out OpenAI to Microsoft entirely, and be housed as Global Principal Product Managers in building 4 in Seattle, where it rains non-stop. Microsoft will never fire you, Satya will always say the right thing about you - because he is an honorable person. 

But deep down in your heart, as you are watching the Netflix movie on OpenAI and Joseph-Gordon Levitt‚Äôs wife plays herself as a board member who fired Sam Altman over Google Meet, you will think and realize that you had it all - you could have been at the helm of a $1 trillion company. History will forget you. Sam and Greg and everyone else would have moved on and forgotten about you. e/acc would have built out fundamental OpenAI alternatives in anycase.."

So they fall back on their newfound credibility in their industry to do seemingly lower risk things: investing, content creation‚Äîlike newsletters & podcasts, and taking well paid exec roles at mature companies. And they will justify it to others by either saying it‚Äôs less stressful than doing it again or that they‚Äôre ‚Äúscaling themselves out.‚Äù

However, while luck certainly played a part in their success, they still are probably the best in their respective field. Not only would it be more fun, rewarding and easier if they tried to do it again, but they are most likely to succeed at it compared to anyone else. Overcoming that doubt is the only thing stopping them."

https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1746581102720893340?s=20,"How you can get ‚Äúlucky‚Äù as an entrepreneur, creator:

1. You can chill. Sometimes, the best way to be productive and come up with the best ideas is to do nothing at all. Allow yourself the space to just be.

2. You dare to disagree. Lucky people don't just go with the flow. They challenge the status quo, question established norms, and aren't afraid to disagree with popular opinion. True innovation starts with a different perspective.

3. You know how to listen to the fringe. The mainstream might give you volume, but the edges give you insights. Pay attention to the outliers, the ones who don't quite fit in. They often see what others miss.

4. You are human, embrace it. I know that sounds obvious, but the best copy sounds like you‚Äôre speaking to a good friend. Jargon and lots of adjectives is unlucky.

4. You post on social, don‚Äôt scroll on social.

5. You ignore noise. There‚Äôs more noise than ever. Deep down, you know what to tune out.

6. You‚Äôre weird. The odd, the unusual, the things that don't fit neatly into a category ‚Äì these are often the seeds of something truly remarkable. Normal gets forgotten, weird gets remembered.

7. You accept pain, don‚Äôt suffer (pain is inevitable, suffering is optional)

8. You‚Äôre obsessed üè¥. This isn't about liking what you do, it's about living it. Your work isn't a part of your life; in many ways, it is your life. Take your mission as seriously as a life-long vow. 

9. You know how to save money. Self-explanatory. Spend less than what you make.

10. You have a bias for action. Understand the urgency. Time is ticking.Taking swift, decisive action sets you apart.

11. You embrace the ""cobbler's children syndrome'"". The cobbler's children have no shoes, reflecting how experts often neglect their own needs. For founders, this means valuing your own product or service enough to use it personally. This self-use can reveal insights  you'd never see otherwise.

12. You ignore instant gratification. The lucky path is often slow and uncertain. Resist the temptation of quick wins that don't align with your long-term vision

13. You‚Äôve got a bench of cheerleaders. Success isn't a solo journey. You need people at all levels ‚Äì those ahead to guide you, those beside to walk with you, and those behind to remind you of how far you've come (and to help them, it‚Äôll pay back too)

14. You don‚Äôt follow growth hacks. If someone is telling you about them loudly on the internet, it‚Äôs too late

15. You don‚Äôt trust what you read. Those public revenue numbers some Twitter creator is posting is probably 1/10 of what you read. Stick to your plan.

16. You build brands that pass the ""T-shirt test"". Your brand should be so good people want to wear it on t-shirts.

17. You know how to subtract. Luck doesn't always come from adding more features, elements, or services. Sometimes, taking away - simplifying - leads to a more powerful impact.

18. You know all about reverse mentors. Usually, mentorship flows from more experienced to less. But reverse mentorship - seeking insights from those younger or less experienced - can open up new perspectives and innovative ideas, tapping into fresh, unjaded viewpoints.

19. You know how to celebrate the ‚Äúnear wins‚Äù. Not every effort will be a resounding success. Sometimes, the near wins ‚Äì the almost-there's ‚Äì can teach more and lead to greater long-term success than immediate victories.

20. You create movements, not businesses. The most interesting businesses people rally around them. They are movements.

21. You have a 1000 true fans. Everything else is gravy.

22. You embody ""Schr√∂dinger's Cat in decision-making. Just like the famous quantum physics thought experiment, where a cat in a box is simultaneously alive and dead, founders often face decisions where outcomes are equally probable and uncertain. Embracing this uncertainty can lead to exploring multiple pathways simultaneously, keeping options open until the last responsible moment. It's going to be okay, go back to bed.

23. When you‚Äôre reaching out to someone be short and sweet. No one has time to read long emails. Bonus points if you send short, interesting Loom videos.

24. You design brands that have lotus qualities. The lotus flower remains clean in muddy water due to its self-cleaning properties. For brands, this represents maintaining integrity and clarity of purpose amidst market turmoil and chaos. You think about this often.

25. You start with the end.  Instead of starting with what you want to create, start with what you want to change. Lucky work often comes from looking at the end goal and working backwards.

26. You know how to unlearn. Sometimes, the barrier to being lucky is what you already know. Challenge your own expertise and be willing to unlearn and relearn.

27. You have physical density, internet density or both. Physical density is living in NYC and meeting your business hero in a coffeeshop. Internet density is building an audience so your hero DMs you on a random Tuesday. 

28. You turn your work into fun. If it's fun, you're playing a game and you tapdance to work everyday. 

29. You stay healthy. Sometimes you get dealt a rough hand, but you do everything in your power to stay as healthy as you can

30. You pay it forward. (feel free to share this post to spread it)

What would you add to this list?

Lots of this is easier said than done. But the idea is to work on it.

Everyone is a work-in-progress. I remember meeting some of my heroes and realizing that they have the same insecurities as we all do. Everyone is doing their best.

Keep going.

https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1746192048103776540?s=20,"Hey, I'm ex-Reddit advisor and sold a community platform to WeWork.

I noticed something BIG recently if you're looking to build cash-flowing internet businesses:

There are 1.8B active users in Facebook Groups in 2024

But I've noticed 95% of paid communities are dead. RIP. There's something new taking its place. 

Memberships are the new internet community.

Let me explain‚Ä¶ grab a coffee it's worth understanding 

When 2020 hit, the world moved to internet communities.

Facebook Groups skyrocketed to 1B+ active users. Discord hit $15B valuation.

Group chat was the new social network.

Now, most of these communities were free.

But naturally, people wanted to monetize these communities.

""Pay us a monthly fee and you‚Äôll get access to a community.""

Every Tom, Dick and Harry were selling paid communities.

Money was flowing. Until it wasn't.

Retention was the major issue. People just weren‚Äôt coming back and would rather spend their money on IRL things like going to Coachella or traveling to Europe.

Turns out selling a velvet rope wasn‚Äôt the right product for monetizing most of these communities.

Something has shifted over the last 18 months. The communities that are actually working aren‚Äôt communities, they‚Äôve become memberships.

What‚Äôs the difference? Let's break it down.

A paid community is paying for access to:

1. Community

The team is usually a community manager or a founder + community manager

A membership includes things like:

1. Community
2. Paid newsletter
3. Discounts & deals
4. IRL events
5. Software
6. Job boards
7. Digital assets (templates, resources etc).
8.Etc

The team is usually founder, community manager, content team, product team.

Here's how to think of it:

A membership is a swiss army knife, a paid community is a spoon.

Sometimes a spoon is helpful, especially when you‚Äôre trying to eat a hot soup.

But try cutting a rib steak with a spoon. You‚Äôll be there all night. Good luck!

Memberships are 10x more versatile, 10x more value, 10x more word-of-mouth and 10x better retention

The memberships that outperform have 2 things in common:

1) A strong identity (being a part of something, rallying behind a mission)

2) People who are trying to get from point A to point B (a transition needs to occur)

I‚Äôm spending a lot of my energy thinking about memberships:

Because I believe that there will be some mega businesses that might look like ‚Äúsilly little memberships‚Äù right now that blossom into some mega memberships in the future.

Community is the currency of the new internet and memberships is how you‚Äôll get paid.

And make the most impact.

The future of internet communities are memberships.

You heard it here first.

Are you seeing the same thing I am?

Communities dying, memberships thriving....

https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1745546887887819088?s=20,"This is the wrong approach.

The real billion dollar opportunity in SaaS is this:

1) Unbundle SaaS businesses like Salesforce into many verticals (vertical > horizontal)
2) Clone and make 100% feature complete (not 80%)
3) Move business model to pay-per-usage over monthly SaaS (many people are sick of monthly)
4) Make the product & brand delightful (much of SaaS is soulless) 
5) Use internet audiences, b2b creators, community to power distribution
6) 95% discount (not 90%)
7) Add each software to a holding company to compete with Salesforce, Adobe etc...

Most of these SaaS businesses can be spun up for under $50,000 thanks to AI and offshoring. Payback could be huge.

The future of SaaS is vertical & pay-per-usage.

It's working for a few reasons:

1) It‚Äôs software-like MRR without having to compete against Microsoft by starting a paid monthly community

2) Each B2B segment will have paid communities. It‚Äôs the unbundling of YPO meets the unbundling of Slack/FB Groups

3) It's tied into email. Skool allows you to send emails efficiently because realistically most people aren't checking Skool first thing in the AM

4) It allows for group admins to create levels. So, if someone is super active in my community, they can get access to new content, or 1:1 call with me etc

5) Pricing. It's $99/month to start a community and begin charging. If you have a paid community, the fees are lower than stripe, so it's a no brainer.

I believe in it so much, I buy it for everyone in my private community ""community empire"" for people trying to build big businesses powered by the internet.

If you want a free Skool, private Q&A with me, learn how to build internet audiences/community, free monthly startup ideas email, p2p business groups... join below

My goal with the group is to find cool like-minded people who I can partner with in the future or hire or learn from.

I'll probably increase the price soon and cap the seats if quality ever declines. It's too cheap rn.

1. Startup valuation is literally a made up number

2. It's impossible to work with people who don‚Äôt answer texts within 24h 

3. The internet can be your lottery ticket or your prison sentence

4. If Abercrombie & Fitch can rebrand (up 285% in 2023), then you can rebrand too

5. Having an internet audience is still wildly underpriced

6. Build products that no one asks for but everyone wants

7. It's actually a good idea to be poor in your 20s and reinvest everything in yourself (learnings, travel, network, figuring out who you are)

8. Google is probably not going to ‚Äúcopy your startup‚Äù

9. Content is your salesperson that works for you 24/7

10. Look for opportunities that are low status now, but probably high status in a few years

11. Lifestyle businesses are still massively underrated. You can often turn them into non lifestyle business if you want

12. Avoid dependency on anything. Social apps, VCs etc. Freedom is two words: self-sustaining

13. Taking a break doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre lazy, burn out is real

14. Whatever you do, don't be mid-curve

15. The only things that should change your mood are things that will change your life

16. Copycats are a nuisance, not killers. They are usually mosquitoes, not sharks.

17. Good design can‚Äôt fix a poor product. But good design can multiply a product that‚Äôs working.

18. People follow a journey, not a social account.

19. If you‚Äôre doing stuff you hate, you aren‚Äôt rich

20. Don't create a startup without a ""why now""

21. Strangers don‚Äôt want to hear about you. They want to talk about themselves or better themselves.

22. The best negotiators talk 10% of the time, and listen 90%

23. Good things happen when you add value to people‚Äôs lives through content & community

24. You could learn a lot about someone by their likes on Twitter

25. First find the niche, then learn from the community, then the startup idea will come to you

26. On hiring: if it isn‚Äôt a hell yeah, it‚Äôs a hell no. Never compromise for fit.

27. Startups never go according to plan. There is no real plan for startups, only a direction

28. The best businesses are the ones that look like a movement. It needs to be an identity, not a product.

29. Your identity is never your company ever. Your company is your business

30. Change scenery 2-3x per day to be extra creative

31. People always want to see behind-the-scenes

32. The happiest people live pretty simple lives, not chasing more and more

36. Cash flow over valuation any day of the week

37. Hire global talent. The world is bigger than NYC or Silicon Valley.

38. You create your own narrative. Narrative drives word-of-mouth which drives revenue which is your oxygen.

39. If something is sold out, customers want it 10x more. Human nature.

40. Diversify cash flow every year. multiple bets, multiple products

41. Selling your first company is an emotional journey

42. Designing rituals into your communities is what brings people back. Remind them to ‚Äòsee you tomorrow

46. Listen to podcasts and take notes. It‚Äôs basically like you‚Äôre sitting in the room with the world‚Äôs greatest founders and entrepreneurs

48. The only audience you have is the audience you own (email, texts, community etc)

https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1743648532278501424?s=20,"We just finished our 2024 kickoff exec offsite in Miami and I have some notes to share with you

10 lessons from our offsite building out our 8 figure holding company:

Lesson #1: Don't build a business that can't reach $10M+/year of cash-flow somehow

This is a good prompt for everyone.

Sure, you can have some micro-businesses that chase smaller profits or businesses that have alternative goals like credibility or just learning, but asking yourself how this business can get to $10M+/year of cash-flow is a good brainstorming prompt.

Realization: we have 1 business in no-mans land with no clear path to $10M+.

Sometimes you gotta be the grim reaper and kill some startups and double down with the ones that have a clear path to $10M+

You can‚Äôt be everywhere. And ever new business splits the attention of the partners of the business

Lesson #2: The best startup ideas are painfully obvious

We spent several hours brainstorming an idea in a space we liked.

After hours of painfully trying to figure out what to build, we realized that our best ideas came to us pretty quickly.

Lesson #3: The F&G Framework for business

We look at each business from a fulfillment and growth perspective.

Fulfillment = are customers getting an exceptional experience?

Growth = are we attracting and converting strangers into customers at a clip we like?

It‚Äôs a simple framework to figure out how the business is going.

If a business isn't nailing fulfillment, we don't want 1 single more customer. We created a fulfillment plan.

If a business is crushing fulfillment and needs growth help, we created a 3-4 channel growth plan for it.

Sometimes business is more simple than we think.

Lesson #4: Don't build the software, then build the community

Start with the community, then build the software

The 
@latecheckoutplz
 operating thesis: build community before building the product.

Keep your operating thesis near and dear.

Lesson #5: The best product hires come from gaming or consumer social

They know how to get people to do things on digital products

Our best product hires weren‚Äôt ex-Meta or Google. They had experience building zero-to-one. 

Often they were ex-consumer social or gaming. Those people were most likely to be 10x-ers even on B2B SaaS and they were B2C consumer social.

Lesson #6: If something is sold out, customers want it 10x more

It's human nature.

This lesson is self-explanatory.

Lesson #7: 90% of minimum viable products can be created in 24h or less

Yeah, you heard me right!! 24h!

We‚Äôve built several 7 figure businesses in under 24h.

Pretty crazy to think about. But giving your team constraints on MVPs is critical.

Your MVP is probably more complex than you‚Äôd care to admit.

Lesson #8: Once you have product/market fit, two main efforts become scale & diversify

Scale so your business can reach its potential. Diversify in case one revenue channel starts drying up.

Sometimes this requires separate teams.

Lesson #9: If you have to ask if you have product market fit, you don‚Äôt have it.

Period.

Lesson #10: Find cool places to do your offsites

We got an airbnb. It wasn‚Äôt crazy expensive. $750/night, 6+ bedrooms. That's $125/room way cheaper than a hotel. But it was super cool. On a river. Something memorable. Had a few kayaks etc and a huge pool.

More memorable offsites in 2024. They work especially if you don't just brainstorm, you make decisions.

The best creative ideas rarely come from staring at a computer screen or iphone.

I'll say the quiet parts out loud:

1. Revenue per employee is going through the roof. What happens when tech companies need 10% or lower of the employees? Mass layoffs and less hiring.

2. Your big tech company job is at risk. If we‚Äôve learned anything from the 2021/2022 layoffs is that you probably should have a side hustle if you‚Äôre at bigtech

3. Most VCs are soul-searching right now. What's the role of VC in 2024 when it‚Äôs never been cheaper to build software? Chasing LLM startups or hardware companies.

4. Most brand social accounts are dead. Some creators will be created to be C-Suite at large brands. These deals will be 7-8 figures.

5. All SaaS apps are about get copied. AI makes that easy. Prices of SaaS products will go down.

6. There's a bunch of creators on tech X who literally just copy people's content. 

7. Affiliate marketing is in its heyday. TikTok has become the largest affiliate platform in the world.

8. Cash flow is way more interesting than valuation. Your stress levels are way lower when you run cash-flowing businesses versus on the VC train

9. Lot of jerks on the internet, but building an audience is worth it. 

10. It's still low status to build an audience. Only once you hit thousands of likes per post does it move up status. Keep going.

11.There is no middle class creator. You are either scrambling to pick up a dollar or follower or flooded with dollars or followers

12. Dividends are about to get way more common for founders. Raising money and giving a % of future profits makes so much sense

13. If you want to get rich, don‚Äôt be a VC-backed founder. Odds are against you. Be a VC-backed founder if it's your dream.

14. A bunch of creator-led products are going to burn their brand in an instant. Some will be pretty high profile.

15. People are waking up to the fact that working for big tech is tough, working at a vc-backed startup and the safest/most desirable place to be is go independent

16. Most ghostwritten tweets have no soul. People aren't dumb, they recognize that tweet is written by an agency.

1. We listened to some bad advice for our innovation agency Late Checkout Agency. ‚ÄúKeep your team lean, a recession is coming, your Fortune 500 clients will cut innovation budgets‚Äù. We listened and that unnecessarily capped revenue. 

The reality is, these big companies need new products that drive revenue and community more than ever during a rough market.

We lost out on $3M+ by just not listening to this advice. Damn.

You get a $20B offer. Finally, after 11 years of starting the company, you see that financial payoff.

Crazy part is, you‚Äôve never even been to London and you don‚Äôt like tea very much.

So, deal is off.

This is the new reality of VC-backed founders.

It‚Äôs IPO or bust for the most part.

I think lots of founders and soon-to-be founders will look at this and ask themselves:

Why would I go the VC route?

The path to liquidity is tough. Yeah, maybe you can sell some secondary shares in a Series A or B.

But also, you‚Äôre reliant on VCs to make that happen for you. Are you really in control of your destiny?

1. Marry the niche, date the product

3. Educate over entertain. You can have more fun entertaining, you can make more money if you educate and if you do both you'll never need to find a job in your life again

4. Make friends with people in your industry. Earn their trust. Don‚Äôt ask for anything for a long time. Overwhelm with value. It‚Äôll payback.

5. Be different. Don‚Äôt just copy what other people do. Be the one that gets copied, not doing the copying. Way more cool.

6. Listen to podcasts and take notes each time. It‚Äôs basically like you‚Äôre sitting in the room with the world‚Äôs greatest founders and entrepreneurs. Share notes with others, discuss.

7. Throw small 10 person events in major cities. You can‚Äôt win on the internet by just being only on the internet. 

8. DM someone new everyday. Send them a Loom on why they should care.

9. Have an email list. Don‚Äôt trust any social platform. Bank on your email list, not your follower count.

10. Be good at introducing yourself. Your bio should reflect that. Everyone is interesting in one way or another.

11. Have goals. Quantify them. Ask people how you're doing.

12. Have a monthly investor update but just for trusted industry friends. Make it max 25 people. Ask for feedback on how you're doing. You can include your friends and family on it

13. Don't raise VC if you don't need to. Spoiler alert: you probably don't need to

14. Spend money on ads. It'll teach you how to write well in your niche because you don't want to waste any dollars. And you'll learn quickly what resonates with your niche.

15. Focus on 1 social platform first, with one format of post. Until you have 100k followers, do not look at anything else.

16. Be data-informed not data-driven. Don't do things because your analytics are telling you to do. You're a human being, you understand your community, act with a mix of art and science.

17. Put buy buttons on the internet. Let people buy your products in many places. Don't be shy to sell.

18. Get on the internet to post content ideas, get off the internet to get content ideas. ‚ÄúHow vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.‚Äù

19. Set post notifications for the most interesting people in your space. Reply thoughtfully. You'll learn a lot.

20.  Big conferences are a waste of time and money. Better spend time/money elsewhere.

21. Don't get jaded. They'll be bumps in the road, jerks on social, people copying your product but the internet is your oyster. Yours for the taking.

1. Use social media apps on desktop only so you don‚Äôt get sucked in.

2. Use analogies. People remember them.

3. Being on someone's IG close friends doesn't mean you are close friends.

4. The fastest way to get out of your town is by building an internet audience to attract people into the same 
stuff as you are.

5. Build an email list yesterday.

6. Don‚Äôt be the last one to leave the party, you've got a big day tomorrow.

7. Come to dinner prepared with interesting stories.

8. Start a ""no-complaints"" day and shift perspectives. Listen more than talk.

9. Use your favorites on the contact screen and call those people at least once a week (also, call your mom).

10. Show up to meetings with small gifts (the ROI is insane).

11. Build your own BS detector. Most of what you read is BS.

12. Gift your friends randomly. Be a secret santa not just during the holidays.

13. Keep a learning list, make learning your ‚Äúside-hustle.‚Äù

14. Use colored pens to enhance note-taking.

15. Create themed playlists, curate moods. They are time capsules for you to remember chapters in your life

16. Listen to happy music often. I do reggae on Sundays.

17. Create your personal ""quote collection"" to stay inspired.

18. Don‚Äôt forget about day 1 friends. They‚Äôve known you from the start.

19. But don‚Äôt keep friends around for the sake of it. Friends help other friends grow.

20. Craft a personal mission statement to guide your decisions.

21. Throw dinner parties and invite the most interesting people you can find. Do it in multiple cities

22. Chasing generational wealth is overrated. Wealth is underrated.

23. Give friends lifts, pick them up from the airport.

24. Amplify your weird, celebrate your uniqueness.

25. Send friends songs you think they‚Äôll like.

26. Pour people‚Äôs drinks before yours. People appreciate that.

27. When you‚Äôre out with people breaking bread, put your phone on airplane mode.

28. Seek discomfort daily, put it in your calendar

29. You‚Äôre never too late. I went to a Phish show in 2005 and everyone told me Phish was over. 

30. Avoid prescription drugs, it‚Äôs a slippery slope.

31. Zig when others zag. The coolest products/communities are built to feel different.

32. When reading articles or books, take photos of important passages or quotes with your phone for easy reference later. Add to a folder. Print it out.

33. Send postcards to friends and family when you travel.

34. Say ""I appreciate you,"" instead of ""appreciated."" It‚Äôs appreciated.

35. Listen to pump-up songs before important meetings or events. Get in the zone.

36. Tone of voice is the secret key to convincing people. Language is what we say, tone is how we say it. Study the greats and see how they do it. Then mimic them.

37. Have a reverse bucket list. Regularly write down things you've already accomplished. It's a reminder of where you came from.

38. Embrace the quiet of the night/early AM. It‚Äôs the most creative time of the day.

39. Keep your computer desktop clean. Regularly change your wallpaper to something that inspires you.

40. Avoid angry people. They suck the good energy out of the room.

41. Eat salads for lunch.

42. Don‚Äôt get offended by people on the internet.

43. Avoid people who are quick to criticize others all the time. Toxic.

44. Life never goes according to plan.

45. If you are safe, control your own schedule, feel at peace, and are growing every year, then you are wealthy.

46. The best business people are relaxed. Inhale, exhale.

47. Have at least 1 thing for sale on the internet. Have buy buttons on the internet.

48. Be curious about new technologies. 

49. Markers of success ‚Äî how well you slept and how much you smiled today

50. Be nice on the internet."

- 75% of the market is controlled by Match Group, and the remaining 25% is controlled by Bumble
- No wonder so many lonely people nowadays
- I could see a swing back to meeting people IRL
- It's a flex to meet your S/O IRL in 2024"

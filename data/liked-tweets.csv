- chatGPT released
- google execs freak out
- google consolidates (integrates Deepmind, Brain)
- google assembles a giant team to build a single giant language model (spoiler: it's gemini)
- team defines success as building the system that gets the best performance on MMLU
- team starts building model
- finds out that beating GPT-4 level performance is really hard
- many cycles of experimental iteration ensue, all with bottom-line MMLU performance dictating success
- data mix, architectural decisions, training hyperparameters, etc. are chosen **to maximize MMLU score**
- Google releases Gemini Ultra, a model that gets the best MMLU score in the world, but isn't nearly as generally capable as GPT-4

It‚Äôs okay to move to a more expensive city and do things to treat yourself

If you‚Äôre smart and ambitious your income is going to rise year over year

Once you have a decent nest egg $100k+ your ability to save is going to grow rapidly as that compounds in the market

Your life is going to be pretty much the same between a $250k-$1M net worth so focus on things in life that will give you full step function changes in the quality of your life instead of incremental

If you‚Äôre under 30 and have $250k liquid you‚Äôre so far ahead of so many people 

It‚Äôs literally the 0.0001% that are FB SWEs with $1M liquid at 30

The issue is that probably 60-80% of the world if not more lives pay check to paycheck and doesn‚Äôt save or think about the future

This is the group of people most general advice is given to

Not the ambitious self-made hustlers

The happy medium is thinking 10-20 years in the future but still spending money to enjoy yourself 

Also, do things that have a high ROI

With open source RAGs (plugins for LLMs) we can even add stuff like GPT-4 Vision, web browsing and data analysis and reach features parity with GPT-4 and future versions

This democratizes the entire LLM world and means it's possible it won't be monopolized by 3 different BigTech giants but be usable for everyone without any filters and restrictions

This means so many more creative uses of it without limits set by tech companies in San Francisco

It'll be a lot like what Stable Diffusion did for AI image generation

We just need to make open source LLMs easy to use now for normal people

LMstudio dot ai is a nice start but still too complicated to use, eg you have to search and download and pick your own model weights. Just preset it for people! Too much open source engineer thinking and not enough normal user thinking IMHO

Anyway very exciting time

https://x.com/varun_mathur/status/1725971418238849154?s=20,"Dear Mira and Ilya - congratulations on your coup at OpenAI. Since both of you have together never raised a penny as entrepreneurs, let me explain what happens.

Oh, and you *will* need to raise since your venture‚Äôs unit economics don‚Äôt make sense. Remember, you pay $0.30 every time someone asks a doofus question to ChatGPT. Heck, I sometimes ask the same thing 5 times. 

Also, the last deal at $80 billion valuation - is as dead as the Egyptian pharaohs. Glorious to write about and visualize. But super dead, under the sand, not coming back. 

Not only that - but you sideswiped your biggest partner, Microsoft. Of course publicly they will say the right thing, but you know and they know it and a random fellow like me knows it - they must be seething mad about it. 

Few of your top researchers have already quit, and if there is one thing Sam Altman is especially good at, it is raising and deploying capital. Before the sign with your name and title as ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefacto CEO‚Äù gets emblazoned in the OpenAI offices, Sam would have a new company, $1 billion investment and offers out to all your, soon to be ex, top product people and researchers. 

So you head into next week having lost your top dealmaker, top researchers, top product visionary, top partner and top investor, and with a business which has terrible unit economics.  

And let‚Äôs not forget - the two of you are not entrepreneurs. Most people in your board have never held a proper tech job ever. You have never had to face the abject rejection which follows from pitching many investors, going through the process, and getting to close. Getting to close is the toughest. Sometimes investors say yes, but they don‚Äôt actually mean it. Sometimes they even sign, and still don‚Äôt wire the funds. You will need to live through all of it, the pain and rejection, and feel intense amount of pressure of having to provide for your team members - who pays their mortgages, car loans, kids school tuition - the ones whom you played with at the last company picnic. 

After you are exhausted with the realities of the market - you will sell out OpenAI to Microsoft entirely, and be housed as Global Principal Product Managers in building 4 in Seattle, where it rains non-stop. Microsoft will never fire you, Satya will always say the right thing about you - because he is an honorable person. 

But deep down in your heart, as you are watching the Netflix movie on OpenAI and Joseph-Gordon Levitt‚Äôs wife plays herself as a board member who fired Sam Altman over Google Meet, you will think and realize that you had it all - you could have been at the helm of a $1 trillion company. History will forget you. Sam and Greg and everyone else would have moved on and forgotten about you. e/acc would have built out fundamental OpenAI alternatives in anycase.."

So they fall back on their newfound credibility in their industry to do seemingly lower risk things: investing, content creation‚Äîlike newsletters & podcasts, and taking well paid exec roles at mature companies. And they will justify it to others by either saying it‚Äôs less stressful than doing it again or that they‚Äôre ‚Äúscaling themselves out.‚Äù

However, while luck certainly played a part in their success, they still are probably the best in their respective field. Not only would it be more fun, rewarding and easier if they tried to do it again, but they are most likely to succeed at it compared to anyone else. Overcoming that doubt is the only thing stopping them."

However, others are criticizing the management and the unit economics of the company, stating that those at the helm lack entrepreneurial experience and predicting a dire future for the company. There is also mention of the strained relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, speculating that the latter must be upset over recent developments. The ex-Twitch CEO's role at OpenAI is also being questioned. Overall, while there seems to be appreciation for the organization's technical advancements, there is also skepticism and concerns regarding its financial stability, managerial competence and strategic partnerships.\n",

It also notes that as an ambitious person, your income is likely to increase each year and once you've saved more than $100k, your ability to save will increase rapidly due to compounding market growth. The tweet emphasizes the importance of focusing on things that can significantly improve your life quality, rather than small incremental changes. Lastly, it encourages thinking long-term about the future while still spending money to enjoy the present.\n",

      "According to the tweets, the best opportunities for young ambitious individuals are to take calculated risks and invest in oneself, like moving to a more expensive city if it offers better opportunities or experiences. It's suggested that they learn skills that increase their value, such as learning how to sell, how to build, and how to use an LLM (presumably, a kind of productivity tool or software). Adopting a long-term view, e.g. thinking 10-20 years into the future, is also recommended. Another opportunity mentioned is starting their own business, implying that entrepreneurship can be a worthwhile venture for ambitious young individuals.\n",

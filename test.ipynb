The term \"linguistic computation\" is used in a positive manner here.\n",

There's speculation that the company is facing significant challenges, including poor unit economics, the loss of key staff including top researchers and a foremost dealmaker, and potential clashes with partners like Microsoft. Commentators suggest that new leadership at OpenAI might lack the necessary business experience to successfully raise capital and support their team.\n",

      "According to the tweets, there was a potential acquisition of Figma by Adobe that was valued at $20 billion. However, the deal fell through reportedly due to issues with a regulatory body in the UK. The process of Adobe deciding not to buy Figma allegedly took 15 months because of the time it took for them to open up Acrobat Reader to check out the contract. This situation has resulted in discussions about the challenges of being a VC-backed founder and the potential benefits of bootstrapping or raising capital and issuing dividends.\n",

It advises focusing on aspects of life that can greatly improve quality of life rather than just incremental changes, highlighting that if someone under 30 has $250k in liquid assets, they're far ahead of many people financially. It also encourages long-term planning and focusing on high ROI activities.
